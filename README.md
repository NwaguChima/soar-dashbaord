## Note To Add

- With more time, I could have refactored and cleaned up most of the components, ensuring they are completely all reusable
- Also, the font and color tokens, could all be added to the tailwind config and used directly, in case the primary color needs to be changes
- The chats, usually if one don't find a library that gives exactly what design has, we take a bit of time, to customize it to fit the design, but in this case, the time allotted, with my schedule didn't let me do that.
- Looking forward to speaking to your team

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
